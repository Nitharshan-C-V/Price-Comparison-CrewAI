            "Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2013 Verified Purchase\n",
            "I would recommend this record to anyone who is a jazz, contemporary jazz, R&B, soul, Blues and/or Classical jazz music lover or anyone who likes to relax and listen to a good album here and there. I love every song on this album and the vinyl record makes your nostalgia take over. I am very young and this album came out before I was born, but growing up listening to contemporary Jazz reminded me of this new wave that took over in the 80's. Miles Davis's sweet melodic horn playing is very pleasing to me and the musical phrases are so intelligent and creative. He uses a mute in the majority of the album that provides a high pitched soft sound. I'm no music genius, so please don't butcher my musical descriptions. I just enjoy good music and this is exceptional. I think this was his last full album before he died in the 80's.This album had the fusion of synthesizers, soprano sax and a great percussion section. I can't pick a favorite song but I would name Portia, half nelson and backyard ritual as the top, but all of them are amazing and great for any mood. Please buy this album if you can find it and support good music. I would listen to this album over any crap that is flooding our radios. TuTu is the best album I've ever heard.\n",

            "I love Miles Davis. On this CD, he mixes various jazz styles and funk together to create this awesome CD. My favorite song on this CD is called \"Tomaas\". As a musician, I have always appreciated Miles Davis style of music. Some listeners my find his style of music \"too deep\", but this man is certainly a musical genius in my opinion. If I were you, I would definitely buy this CD. Don't base your opinion on the 20 second sound samples that you hear on amazon.com. Dare to be song satisfied!\n",

            "If you like Miles when he was exploring new styles then this well worth a listen. Very like Doo Bop but with hints of the composition and instruments of Sketches from Spain and Siesta. It's nothing like Bitches Brew or In a Silent way (which I also have). Two 180gm disks for ¬£18.99, and they're both well recorded - fabulous! The studio disk of Tutu sounds a little overproduced but the Live at Nice Festival in 1986 is superb. It's also got the inestimable Marcus Miller as producer and arranger so you can be sure there's some funk in there!\n",
